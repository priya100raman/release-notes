The kit contains documentation and software to make a lab
[[../index.org::#glossary-autodeployment][/auto deployable/]] and [[./ldk-0.5.org::#uicompliance][/UI-1.0 Compliant/]].

* Auto Deployment
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: autodeployment
:END:
 With the help of software and documentation available in
 the lik, an integration engineer can

 1. Run auto-deployment service on an integration engineer's
    workstation and deploy a lab on a virtual machine
    created on the workstation.  This step allows an
    engineer to test the lab for auto deployability.

 2. Request to deploy a lab in the hosting ifrastructure of
    IIIT-H.  The auto deployment service running in the IIIT
    infrastructure deploys the lab in an independent VM.


* UI 1.0 Compliance
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: uicompliance
:END:
  The software and documentation in the LIK allows an
  integration enginner to:

  1. Provide a Unified look and feel :: The UI 1.0 Toolkit
       offers a uniform user interface for authoring and
       interacting with the virtual labs.  It also provides
       labs a simple and uniform web interface and a
       homogeneous hosting framework.

  2. Adhere to coding standards :: The Toolkit ensures that
       lab developers follow good programming practices to
       make the code of the labs efficient and readable.

  3. Upgrade widgets and components :: The UI 1.0 template
       makes it easy for lab developers to modify and update
       widgets and/or components.

  4. Provide for better versions of template :: In future,
       if advanced versions of the UI template are created,
       the lab developers can transfer the lab content
       automatically as per the new versions.
