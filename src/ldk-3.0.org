deployment of applications is supported on virtual machines
running =Centos= operating system.  For more details refer
to the /[[https://github.com/vlead/ovpl/releases/tag/v1.4.0][release]]/ /[[https://github.com/vlead/ovpl/releases/tag/v1.4.0][notes]]/ of the /[[https://github.com/vlead/ovpl/releases/tag/v1.4.0][OVPL 3.0]]/ /[[https://github.com/vlead/ovpl/releases/tag/v1.4.0][release]]/.

:CUSTOM_ID: webcompliance
:END:
The /[[https://github.com/openedx-vlead/port-labs-to-openedx/releases/tag/v1.1.0][release]]/ contains the documentation and software to port
labs to Open edX platform.  Once a lab is ported to Open edX
platform, the lab becomes responsive.  For more details
refer to the /[[https://github.com/openedx-vlead/port-labs-to-openedx/releases/tag/v1.1.0][release]]/ /[[https://github.com/openedx-vlead/port-labs-to-openedx/releases/tag/v1.1.0][notes]]/ of the /[[https://github.com/openedx-vlead/port-labs-to-openedx/releases/tag/v1.1.0][Web Compliance 3.0]]/

The /[[https://github.com/vlead/analytics-db/releases/tag/v1.0.0][analytics]]/ service is developed that exposes a set of
API to display usage and hits of Virtual Labs.  This server
stores usage information from the Open edX platform.  For
more details refer to the /[[https://github.com/vlead/analytics-db/releases/tag/v1.0.0][release]]/ /[[https://github.com/vlead/analytics-db/releases/tag/v1.0.0][notes]]/ of the /[[https://github.com/vlead/analytics-db/releases/tag/v1.0.0][Analytics]]/

* Secutiy Framework 3.0
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: securityframework
:END:
All labs at integration levels 5 & 6 are deployed on AWS
cloud.  The cloud is designed in such a way that the virtual
machines hosting the labs are not accessible to the outside
world.  A layer of security is built on top of these VMs
such that the traffic is directed through a single machine
called =router=.

* Persistence API 3.0
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: persistence
:END:
/[[https://vlabs.ac.in][Over 90 labs]]/ are ported to Open edX /[[https://vlabs.ac.in][platform]]/.  The
platform provides persistence where the user in a new
session is moved to the same section that he/she has
accessed in the previous session.  The procedure to setup
the platform and port virtual labs to the platforms is part
of a /[[https://github.com/openedx-vlead/port-labs-to-openedx/blob/develop/src][repository]]/ on /[[https://github.com/openedx-vlead/port-labs-to-openedx/blob/develop/src][github]]/.  For more details refer to
the /[[https://github.com/openedx-vlead/port-labs-to-openedx/releases/tag/v1.1.0][release]]/ /[[https://github.com/openedx-vlead/port-labs-to-openedx/releases/tag/v1.1.0][notes]]/ of the /[[https://github.com/openedx-vlead/port-labs-to-openedx/releases/tag/v1.1.0][Persistence 3.0]]/ /[[https://github.com/openedx-vlead/port-labs-to-openedx/releases/tag/v1.1.0][release]]/.

* Performance 3.0
:PROPERTIES:

therefore the Virtual Labs, Central Platform Engineering has
automated the /[[https://github.com/vlead/cluster-automation/releases][creation of the cluster]]/ from a configuration.
The CPE team has also tabulated the performance metrics for
different configurations - CPU, RAM, load etc., by /[[https://github.com/openedx-vlead/cc-pf-tests][designing]]/
a series of /[[https://github.com/openedx-vlead/cc-pf-tests][performance tests]]/.
